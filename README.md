# The Emerald Green: A TTRPG

*The Emerald Green* is a d13 tabletop roleplaying game. *d13* means you use a standard deck of 52 playing cards instead of a d20 or other polyhedral die. Players take on the role of characters who have encountered a fae entity, and received its binding blessing, willingly or otherwise. As characters gain experience, players will have the opportunity to edit their deck to favor their character's playing strategy. However, as all suits and ranks are useful somehow, this specialization leaves them imbalanced, aloof to the mortal world both personally and mechanically. *The Emerald Green* aka **TEG** draws inspiration from [Deadlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlands) and [Changeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling:_The_Lost).

This repository contains the rules and documentation of the game alongside the code that builds its public website, where you can create and manage characters much like [Pathbuilder 2e](https://pathbuilder2e.com/) but without a paywall.
