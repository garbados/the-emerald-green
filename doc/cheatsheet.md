# Cheatsheet

## Characters

Pacts:
- Pacts represent the cards you've *sanctified* and *exiled*.
- Sanctified cards remain in the deck during play.
- Exiled cards are removed from the deck during play.
- Traits apply to you when they match your Pact.
Attributes:
- Add to effective rank of card applied to challenges.
Skills:
- When applicable, may reveal instead of apply. If you do apply, draw a card.
- May ignore challenge demands. Meeting them increases your response's rank.
Will:
- Spend anytime to draw two cards.
Fortune:
- Reveal instead of apply. May ignore challenge demands.

## Challenges

Challenge:
- Select a difficulty in secret.
    - 5: easy (only use this difficulty when failure is likely and important)
    - 7: moderate
    - 9: difficult
    - 11: very difficult
    - 13: superhuman
- You may *unveil* a card from the top of your deck instead of *bestowing* one from your hand, sometimes.
    - When you're skilled, fortunate, or reacting reflexively.
    - If you don't like you unveil, you can bestow instead.
Demands:
- Failing a demand confers -2, unless something else happens.
- Failing is a bit like failing a saving throw.
    - Maybe you defend against a primary effect, but a secondary one happens.
    - Maybe your attack leaves you vulnerable.
    - Maybe you open the lock, but raise an alarm.
Invocations:
    - (bestow) "I challenge your {skill}, and demand a {response}"
    - (unveil) "I witness your {skill}, and prophesy a {demand}."

## Gambling

You may *gamble* to increase the (secret) difficulty of a check by 2.
Generally the effects of this are contextual.
You are especially persuasive using risky, sensitive language.
You pick the lock quickly and quietly -- or break it altogether.
When it comes to attacks, the effect is more mechanical: you trade chance-to-hit for damage.

For each time you gamble, add two damage if your hit connects.
