# Player Guide

Welcome to *The Emerald Green*, AKA **TEG**. I'm the author, Diana. Usually there's a narrator instead, but, why deal in illusions with you, love? This is a guide to a tabletop roleplaying game about people who have gotten in over their heads with things they don't understand -- things they can't. It 

You, a player, take on the role of such a person. When you make a character, you decide what this person's connection to such a *thing* is, and select Tarot cards to form your *Pact*, which confers powers subtle and profound alike. Some cards, which you *sanctify*, you'll keep in your deck during play. Others, which you *exile*, are removed from your deck during play. Your Pact includes all your sanctified and exiled cards. When you level up, sometimes you'll sanctify a new card, but mostly you'll have to exile something.

> *Divination note*: You can read a Pact like a spread, in which sanctified cards are upright, and exiled ones are inverted.

Your character, as a mortal, also deals in items and equipment, your *Livery*. You may sell treasure for coin, buy weapons and armor, and so on. You may also *craft* things -- more on that later. Your Livery does not affect your Pact.

Each in-game day, or after a *long rest*, you begin by shuffling your character's deck and drawing a hand. Over the course of the day, you'll *play* cards to *Respond* to *Challenges*. A Challenge could be anything where success or failure is significant, from attacking a foe, to winning a coin toss. Roughly, it encompasses everything you would roll a d20 for in a game like DnD or Pathfinder. However, you don't generally draw a replacement card after playing one for a challenge, so you must be judicious about how you apply yourself, and use what means you have to keep your hand flush with options.

## The Basics

### Anatomy of a Game

You'll need two or more people to play the game:

- Arbiter: The game-runner, who plays all the NPCs and mediates both the narrative and the rules. Sometimes also called a GM or DM. The Arbiter has secret knowledge of the world that, by withholding it from the players, makes possible the *discovery* of a narrative.
- Players: People playing characters, so-called *player-characters*. Each player will need their own 78-card Tarot deck.

### Anatomy of a Character

You play as a fantasy adventurer whose strengths, above and beyond your mortal peers, arrive from what spiritual natures you have *exiled* or *sanctified*, collectively the Pact that disjuncts your mortal experience into... something else. The game's *traits*, which range from the mundane to the profound, have requirements that activate when they match your Pact. Your character's spiritual natures are the Tarot deck you play with, and as your character grows, you will exile many cards from it, thinning it out and skewing its contents.

**Traits**

- **Name**: What's in a name?
- **Description**: A summary of the trait, for humans.
- **Requires**: An expression describing the conditions under which the trait activates, as a list of special operators ("and", "or", "count") and card tags ("even", "odd", "prime", "swords").
    - **Traits**, **Deck**, **Card**: The requirements which, when satisfied by your Pact and/or other traits, activate and apply to your character. *Traits* indicate the traits you must possess for this trait to activate. *Deck* evaluates the cards in your Pact altogether, while *Card* matches against each one individually. A Trait with a Card requirement will apply as many times as it matches cards in your Pact, provided its *Deck* and *Trait* requirements are also satisfied.
- **Effect**:
    - *Attributes*: Traits may increase some attributes.
    - *Skills*: Traits may provide proficiency in a skill.
    - *Talents*: Traits may grant passive boons.
    - *Abilities*: Traits may grant active techniques.
    - *Fungibles*: Traits may increase the quantity of fungibles like Health.

All your character's *stats* are computed based on your traits, including *attributes* and *skills* and so on.

    - **Spirit**: Creative resolve. *Associated with the suit of Cups.*
    - **Luck**: Divine favor. *Associated with the suit of Pentacles.*
- **Skills**: Specialized aptitudes, in which one is *proficient* or not. Each skill has an associated *attribute*. Challenges that call on a proficient skill are much easier.
    - *Body*

        - **Athletics**: Balancing, tumbling, climbing, swimming, etc.
        - **Intimidation**: Forceful persuasion.

    - **Name**: What's in a name?
    - **Description**: A summary of the talent, for humans.
- **Abilities**: Practiced techniques such as special attacks, spells, etc.
    - **Name**: What's in a name?
    - **Description**: A summary of the ability, for humans.
    - **Phase**: What time-scale this ability concerns, either *encounter* (for combat and hazards), *exploration* (for travel, or several hours), *downtime* (for rest, or a day or more).
    - **Actions**: The number of action points the ability consumes. In an encounter, a turn contains 3 action points. In exploration, an action point represents an hour. In downtime, a day.
    - **Madness**: How much *madness* the ability confers, if any.
- **Fungibles**: Tokens you may gain, lose, spend, and struggle to be rid of.
    - **Health**: Hit points. Lose some when you take damage, restore some from healing and resting. You're unconscious at 0, but you only die when the gods allow it. *Equal to 3 plus Body plus your level, or twice your level if proficient in Resilience.*
    - **Draw**: How many cards you draw after each long rest.
    - **Will**: Spend to draw two cards from your deck. When you do this, you may discard a card to draw another card. You may do this at any time.
    - **Fortune**: Spend to gain *advantage* or to counter *disadvantage*.
    - **Madness**: Accumulated from spellcasting and magical effects. After choosing a card for a response to a challenge, draw and discard cards from the top of your deck equal to your madness. You may choose one of them to use instead of the card you applied. Resting lowers madness.
    - **Wealth**: Your financial liquidity, expressed in terms of *copper* ("c", 1), *silver* ("s", 100c), *gold* ("g", 10,000c), and *platinum* ("p", 1,000,000c).

## Challenges

When facing a tribulation, such as a locked door, or a murderous foe, you may be *challenged* to overcome the situation. In general, whenever a game like DnD would have you roll a d20.

When challenged, the arbiter secretly selects a *difficulty*, which is a number your response must meet or beat. You respond by *applying* a card from your hand, discarding it in the process.

Cards have an *effective rank* that is based on their rank in the deck:

- 2, 3, 4: +2
- 5, 6, 7: +3
- 8, 9, 10: +4
- Page, Knight, Queen: +5
- King, Ace: +6
- Major Arcana: +7

A response's effective rank combines the applied card's effective rank with a relevant attribute, plus or minus other circumstantial modifiers at the arbiter's discretion.

### Demands

Challenges may *demand* a certain kind of response, such as that the player applies a card of a certain suit. A response that does not meet this demand suffers a -2 penalty to its effective rank. If you are proficient in a skill relevant to the challenge, you may ignore this demand at no penalty, or draw a card if you meet it anyway.

*Examples*:

- Combat or feats of body: Swords
- Reasoning or recall: Wands
- Enchantment or defiance: Cups
- Matters of pure chance: Pentacles
- Social activities: Court ranks (page, knight, etc.)
- Divine mysteries: Major arcana
- ???: Odds
- ???: Evens
- ???: Primes (2, 3, 5, 7)

### Gambling

You may *gamble* by increasing the effective difficulty of a challenge by 2. This causes your success to be more significant, and your failure more dire. You may deal more damage, or pick the lock quickly and quietly; you may fumble the attack and hurt yourself, or break the lock with a conspicuous *thunk*.

### Assisting

When appropriate, characters may *assist* each other on checks. This may include helping to push an object, or giving relevant advice. To do this, the assisting character discards the top card of their deck as though they were applying it to the challenge themselves. This pseudo-response must beat the challenge's difficult minus two. That is, a check of difficulty 7 can be assisted by beating a difficulty of 5. A successful assist lowers the challenge's difficulty by 1.

### Advantage, Disadvantage

You may also experience *advantage* or *disadvantage* during challenges. If you have *advantage*, draw a card before choosing a response, and you may ignore the challenge's demands. If you have *disadvantage*, after choosing a response, you must discard an additional card if you have one.

Advantage and disadvantage counter each other, but being dis/advantaged multiple times does nothing. *Being advantaged three times, and disadvantaged once, counts as being advantaged only once.*

### Difficulty Guide

- 4 or less: Trivial; probably not a check. Narratively, ask yourself: why force a character to apply a card to something so easy?
- 5-6: Simple, but significant and possible to fail.
- 7-8: Tricky, being of a sophistication demanding some acumen. 
- 9-10: Complex, requiring a significant degree of mastery.
- 11+: Impossible, requiring almost superhuman prowess.

## Character Creation

To create your character, first follow the following steps.

(Some of these steps can be complicated to do manually. That's why there's a website for making and managing characters and campaigns! Click "New Character" to interactively follow these steps!)

### 0. Why me?

- You have encountered a Fae. How did you meet?
- They took an interest, that you can't fully grasp. What is it?
- You asked for something, and they gave you something. Was it fair?
- They took something in return. Do you miss it?
- Now you have their Blessing. What will you do with it?

Remember these things as you write your character's name and biography.

### 1. Forging the Pact

- Exile three cards from your deck. *Exiled cards are removed from your deck during play. You can always restore them after the session.*
- Sanctify two more. *Sanctified cards are allowed to remain in your deck, but qualify for acquiring traits.*
- Collectively, your exiled and sanctified cards form your Pact.
- Gain all traits whose requirements your Pact satisfies. *You do not choose which traits to acquire. You choose what to Pact, and the consequences happen.*
- Calculate your stats, fungibles, talents, and abilities from your traits.

### 2. Donning the Livery

- Begin with 10 silver pieces.
- Buy any items or equipment of common or uncommon rarity.
- You may buy *one* rare thing, if you can afford it.

### 3. Ta-da!

Your character is complete. You can now use it in campaigns.
