# Introduction to "The Emerald Green"

*The Emerald Green* is a high fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in which you play as a Chosen of a Fae, acting as their unwitting agent, bound to some alien pact. The game is played with a Tarot deck, and you build your character by removing cards from it.

Highlights:
- You play with a hand of cards. Choose how you respond to challenges by applying one or more cards, discarding them from your hand.
- Challenges may demand responses of a certain sort. Specific suits, odds or evens, major or minor arcana, etc.; failure to respond in kind can be punishing.
- Your character's traits are derived from what cards are absent from your deck. Each time you level up, you discard another card, which bequeaths every trait which then matches the cards missing from your deck.

## Player Guide

> **You had never dreamed so furiously. So... shimmering emerald.**
>
> You stepped from nowhere into the Fae Queen's Court, where an endless foyer sprawled. White marble columns adorned with ivy trellises, and arching dome ceilings pocked with stained glass went on and on. Peering through different skylights revealed very, very different skies. Masked nobility moved in eerie unity to a tune you could only hear as if recalling it. Their formal dress and proper fits delayed your realization that there were no faces behind their masks.
>
> Then She found you. Her eminence, Her elegance, Her rapturous, indescribable visage. She offered a green-gloved hand, and said without moving Her mouth, "Dance with me." You took Her grasp before you could so much as consider it. She whirled you into Her arms and back out into Her excited tempo, back and forth, back and forth, for hours, days, weeks, months, years and years and years and years. Your feet grew so weary, but then they were so far away you could not remember having them; your hand clammed from Her touch, but then your hand was made of wood; your lips trembled at Her kiss, and then your lips parted no more, no matter how much you screamed.
>
> It was your first Dancing Dream. You awakened to the same world as you fell asleep to, but something had come between you, as though your home reality lay on the other side of a thin, almost imperceptible veil. You snapped your fingers, just to prove you still had any, and sparks burst from their tips!
>
> First you asked yourself in alarm, "What did She do to me?" But the question faded, as though it had been sucked down into bog-muck. Another query took its place, wriggling to the front of your thoughts like a worm protruding from an apple:
>
> ***What shall you do with My blessing?***

### Character Creation

- Begin with a full tarot deck.
- Then, remove three cards. Gain all traits which would trigger from them being absent.
- Finally, designate two cards as *sanctified*. Gain all traits which would trigger from them being absent, even though they permanently remain a part of your deck. *Sanctified cards cannot be removed from your deck.*

That's it! This determines various qualities of your character:

**Attributes**: General qualities. These are represented as a number that is used when responding to checks, where a higher number makes relevant checks easier to beat.

- Body: Physical excellence. (Suit: Swords)
- Mind: Intellect and reasoning. (Suit: Wands)
- Spirit: Grit and drive. (Suit: Cups)
- Luck: Favor of the universe. (Suit: Pentacles)

**Skills**: Specialized aptitudes. These are represented as being either *advantaged*, neutral, or *disadvantaged*. Checks with skills in which you have advantage are easier to beat; checks with skills in which you are disadvantaged are harder.

- Body:
    - Athletics: Balancing, tumbling, climbing, swimming, etc.
    - Melee: Close-quarters personal combat.
    - Ranged: Sharpshooting, marksmanship.
    - Resilience: Strength of constitution.
    - Intimidation: Forceful persuasion.
- Mind:
    - Arcana: Academic knowledge of magic and magical things.
    - Craft: Making things.
    - Diplomacy: Amiable persuasion.
    - Insight: Putting the clues together.
    - Medicine: Physiology and healing.
- Spirit:
    - Awareness: Acuteness of senses.
    - Deception: Illusory persuasion.
    - Sorcery: Command of the eldritch.
    - Stealth: Sneaking, hiding, inconspicuousness.
    - Resolve: Will to power.
- Luck:
    - Theurgy: Divine favor, religious knowledge.

**Fungibles**: Resources that you spend, accumulate, or lose during the course of play.

- Health: Hit points. Lose some when you take damage, restore some from healing and resting. You're unconscious at 0, but you only die when the gods allow it.
- Hand: After each Long Rest, draw this many cards. You will apply them over the course of play.
- Will: Spend to draw a card from your deck. When you do this, you may discard a card to draw another card.
- Fortune: Spend to gain advantage, or to counter disadvantage.
- Madness: Accumulated from spellcasting and magical effects. When resolving a check, after choosing a card to apply, draw and discard cards from the top of your deck equal to your madness. You may choose one of them to use instead of the card you applied. Resting lowers madness.
- Wealth: Your accessible finances, measured in *gold* (g; 100), *silver* (s; 10), and *copper* (c; 1). Unless the GM indicates otherwise, characters begin with 10 gold.

The [character builder](#TODO) manages this process automatically. Simply choose what cards to remove from your deck, and which to sanctify. The system will calculate the rest.

### Resolving Checks

*Checks* are challenges that include making or defending against an attack, picking a lock, casting a spell, or other challenges that endanger you or that you might fail. Checks have a *difficulty* that is an effective number you must beat. When you apply a card, calculate its effective rank plus the relevant attribute. If this number meets or exceeds the difficulty, you pass the check. A check's difficulty is generally secret!

When you have *advantage*, draw a card when the check resolves. If you have *disadvantage*, discard an additional card along with the card you apply; it does not count toward difficulty.

Effective ranks range from 2 to 6:

- 2, 3, 4: +2
- 5, 6, 7: +3
- 8, 9, 10: +4
- Page, Knight, Queen: +5
- King, Ace: +6
- Major Arcana: +7

You may *gamble* by increasing the effective difficulty of a check by 2. This causes your success to be more significant, and your failure more dire. You may deal more damage, or pick the lock quickly and quietly; you may fumble the attack and hurt yourself, or break the lock with a conspicuous *thunk*.

When appropriate, characters may *assist* each other on checks. This may include helping to push an object, or giving relevant advice. To do this, the assisting character reveals a card from their hand, which must beat the target difficult minus two. That is, a check of difficulty 7 can be assisted by beating a difficulty of 5. A successful assist lowers the check's difficulty by 1.

**Check difficulty guide**:

- 3 or less: Trivial; probably not a check. Narratively, ask yourself: why force a character to apply a card to something so easy?
- 4-5: Simple, but significant and possible to fail.
- 6-7: Tricky, being of a sophistication demanding some acumen. 
- 8-9: Complex, requiring a significant degree of mastery.
- 10+: Impossible, requiring almost superhuman prowess.

### Traits

Traits include a variety of effects, some repeatable, some unique, which provide attributes, skills, passive effects and active abilities. They all have a schema like this:

- Name: A brief title.
- Description: A human-readable effect description.
- Requires: This trait is *in effect* if your deck is all these cards are missing from your deck, or sanctified. This may be specific cards, or specific card groups such as suits, odds, evens, minor arcana, major arcana, etc.
- Effect: Where applicable, the enumerated mechanical consequences of the trait, such as increasing an attribute, advantaging or disadvantaging a skill, influencing fungibles, etc. (Some traits do not have enumerable consequences, and will only be characterized mechanically in their description.)

Traits are listed in game data, and can be reviewed in the [compendium](#TODO).

### Equipment

The weapons, armor, tools, consumables, and other items carried and used by characters. These are bought with and sold for metal currency (gold, silver, copper). All equipment have some properties, while others are type-specific.

- Name: A brief title.
- Description: A human-readable description of the object.
- Enchantments: Special effects associated with the object, such as weird things that occur when using it, or the nature in which the object is cursed.
- Cost: the price of the object in a typical city's market. Actual prices and availability vary in a complex world; listed cost indicates, to some degree, the object's power level.
- Rarity: The typical availability of the item.
    - Common: Things that can be found most anywhere, such as a rural general store.
    - Uncommon: Things that specialists sell, such as an apothecary.
    - Rare: Things that only collectors have, but which are not generally unique in existence.
    - Mythic: Things fabled, prophesied, or thought not to exist at all.

*Weapons* are used in martial conflicts, and include melee and ranged arms.

- Skill: The skill used when attacking with this weapon, specifically Melee, Ranged, Arcana, Sorcery, or Theurgy.
- Damage: The health you subtract on a successful attack, minus the defender's resistance to the damage type. If you gamble successfully on an attack, inflict double damage and bypass resistances.
- Element: The type of damage the weapon inflicts, which indicates the relevant resistance. These include *physical*, *fire*, *frost*, *radiant*, and *shadow*.
- Range: The effective distance of the weapon's attacks, specifically close (requiring adjacency), near (5 spaces), far (10 spaces), distant (20 spaces). Aside from *close* weapons, you may attack at double a weapon's effective range by attacking at disadvantage.

*Armor* protects you from harm, but may encumber you too.

- Resistances: The amount by which harm from one or more types of damage is reduced. Some armor may apply *negative* resistances, increasing damage taken of that type.
- Inertia: A reduction to the number of spaces you may move when taking a move action. Affects *running* (1x) and *sprinting* (2x), but not *stepping*. (ex: armor with inertia 1 reduces the range of *running* by 1, but reduces *sprinting* by 2.)

*Tools* are reusable items that assist with skills. They provide advantage, or counter disadvantage.

- Skill: The skill affected by the tool.

*Consumables* are items that are destroyed when used, such as potions and ammunition.

- Effect: The enumerated mechanical consequences of expending the object, if they are enumerable. Non-enumerable effects are detailed in the object's description. May include damage, healing, an element type, etc.

### Conditions

Many physical and elemental factors may impact your character. Although abilities may describe the specific conditions they apply, there are some common and general ones:

- Exhaustion: Your hand has run out of cards. When a challenge would have you apply a card, discard the top card of your deck and use that one instead.
- Stupefaction: Your deck has run out of cards. You automatically fail checks.
- Unconscious: You have run out of health. You are passed out, and cannot take any actions until you have regained at least one health.
- Bleeding: A significant source of ongoing loss of blood or fundamental vitality. During each turn of a tactical encounter, or during each hour outside of an encounter, take 1 damage which bypasses all resistances.
- Enchanted: Friend and foe blur together. The GM won't tell you, or may lie to you, about what you're seeing, hearing, etc. Can only be dispelled magically. *You may not even be aware you've been enchanted!*
- Exposed: You're off-balance. Attacks against you have advantage.
- Burning: Searing pain distracts you. Checks are made at disadvantage. Resolves with cool water, or frost damage.
- Frozen: Stiff limbs from cold. Reduces the range of *running* by 2 and *sprinting* by 4. Resolves with warmth, or fire damage.
- Maimed: A major impairment, such as a massive wound, or a migraine. All checks are made at -2. Resolves when you gain health.

### Tactical Encounters

When facing off against danger in a moment-to-moment conflict in a physical (or pseudo-physical) space, characters enter a *tactical encounter* in which they take turns taking actions that move them around the *theater* or affect other characters, such as casting spells or making attacks.

A *theater* is the location in which the encounter takes place. It is divided into meter-wide hexagons, each of which is called a space. Typical characters occupy one space. Large entities may occupy more, while smaller entities may cram together many individuals in a space.

When an encounter begins, each player discards the top card of their deck. Characters take turns in order of the effective rank of this card, with ties being resolved arbitrarily. Characters with advantage in Awareness, or who spend Fortune at the beginning of the encounter to gain advantage in it, instead discard the top two cards of their deck and use the better one.

During a character's turn, they may spend up to three action points. Different abilities take different numbers of points. Some basic abilities are shared by all characters:

- Step (1pt): Carefully move one space. This may not be prevented or reduced in range, and will not trigger reactions.
- Run (1pt): Travel up to 5 spaces minus your effective inertia.
- Sprint (2pt): Travel up to 15 spaces minus twice your effective inertia.
- Attack (2pt): Strike an opponent within range.
- Focus (1pt): Ready yourself. Gain 1 Will; you may spend it immediately.
- Analyze (0pt): Spend 1 Will. May only do this once per turn, despite costing no actions.

Traits may grant other tactical abilities.

Characters may also take cover behind features of the environment. Ranged attacks against targets behind cover are at disadvantage, and may be considered impossible if the cover is total (such as a wall). You don't need to take a special action to take cover as long as it's between you and the attacker or effect source.

#### Attacking

When you attack something with an offensive ability, make a difficulty 7 check using the attack's skill and relevant attribute (melee, ranged: body; arcana: mind; sorcery: spirit; etc.). If you exceed the check, you hit. Inflict damage, minus the target's relevant resistances, and apply any of the attack's other on-hit effects.

Defenders may choose to make an *active defense*, which means applying a card to a check whose difficulty is equal to the attack's effective rank. The skill and relevant attribute of this defense are the same as the attack's, unless a trait allows otherwise.
