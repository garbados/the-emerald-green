# The Order of Things

## The Fool

*Il Matto*. The madman. The beggar.
The jester and sycophant and biting between.
The difference from outside.
The beginning you don't realize
has already, already begun.
Could it be you, Enkidu?

## The Two of Swords

Intuition pulls like the moon sometimes, doesn't it?
It tugs on your guts like a new kind of north.
You have to stay steady not just to stay the course,
but to listen to the earth under you, inside of you,
to hear what moves ahead.

## The Two of Wands

You already have so much, you think to yourself sometimes.
Why want more?
My goodness -- why not?
There's so much out there to see and feel and touch and be!
I could be anyone, eventually. Anything.
Why not go a-looking, then?
Let's see what fate has in store!

## The Two of Cups

Who now do I find?
What an offer -- what a trade.
I look at the thundering clouds,
the forest bending before the gale,
and think, just as they say to me,
"We can only get through this together."
So we do. We make it through.
What an offer. What a trade.

## The Two of Pentacles
