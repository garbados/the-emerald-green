# The Order of Things

## The Fool

I begin each day,
But neither is sunset an end.
My arrivals compound everywhere I go,
And I go where I damn please.
No door can stay the intrepid;
No lock, the curious.
The wild green lives in me,
And it blossoms with every dream.

## The Two of Swords

Intuition pulls like the moon sometimes, doesn't it?
It tugs on your guts like a new kind of north.
You have to stay steady not just to stay the course,
But to listen to the earth under you, inside of you,
To hear what moves ahead.

## The Two of Wands

You already have so much, you think to yourself sometimes.
Why want more?
My goodness -- why not?
There's so much out there to see and feel and touch and be!
I could be anyone, eventually. Anything.
Why not go a-looking, then?
Let's see what fate has in store!

## The Two of Cups

Who now do I find?
What an offer -- what a trade.
I look at the thundering clouds,
the forest bending before the gale,
and think, just as they say to me,
"We can only get through this together."
So we do. We make it through.
What an offer. What a trade.

## The Two of Pentacles

My two cents? Balance in all things.
Accounts balance, loves balance,
And everything that falls apart
Is just finding a new balance.
It's deft to dance in the midst,
Because the balance you try to hold
Differs from decay's indifference.

## The Magician

Look at all the little things
Scurrying, loving, breeding, dying.
I remember those things, distantly.
I don't miss the mud and blood and shit
And I wonder why they treasure them.
Let me show you something greater, mortal.
Open those extra eyes
That nobody told you about
And see all that choice can offer.

## The High Priestess

When the heavens call, pick up.
The line might scream with static
But that's hardly unusual.
I just nod and note, asking calmly,
What is the path between? Howling.
What is the truth beyond life? Roaring.
But there's plenty the heavens don't know.
When I ask, how to enlighten my peers
The line goes quiet.
It's always up to us mortals
To fill in the details.

## The Three of Swords

I didn't know a heart could break like that.
You found me in the wild green,
And I found you naked, body and soul.
You invited me in, and we opened flowers
Like you opened my mind.
By the end of seven days, I was someone different.
The unkempt grasses of my homeland
Now pricked the feet you had washed so soft.
So you said, go to the people.
Love is a promise that lives in you.
Through all of us, we give it form.
