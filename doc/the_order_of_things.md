# The Order of Things

## The Fool

I begin each day,
But neither is sunset an end.
My arrivals compound everywhere I go,
And I go where I damn please.
No door can stay the intrepid;
No lock, the curious.
The wild green lives in me,
And it blossoms with every dream.

## The Two of Swords

Intuition pulls like the moon sometimes, doesn't it?
It tugs on your guts like a new kind of north.
You have to stay steady not just to stay the course,
But to listen to the earth under you, inside of you,
To hear what moves ahead.
Strange barriers may cleave you
From the things you find you want.

## The Two of Wands

You already have so much, you think to yourself sometimes.
Why want more?
My goodness -- why not?
There's so much out there to see and feel and touch and be!
I could be anyone, eventually. Anything.
Why not go a-looking, then?
Let's see what fate has for me!

## The Two of Cups

Who now do I find?
What an offer -- what a trade.
I look at the thundering clouds,
The forest bending before the gale,
And think the same words they say to me:
"We can only get through this together."
So we do. We make it through.
What an offer. What a trade.

## The Two of Pentacles

My two cents? Balance in all things.
Accounts balance, loves balance,
And everything that falls apart
Is just finding a new balance.
It's deft to dance in the midst,
Because the balance you try to hold
Differs from decay's indifference.

## The Magician

Look at all the little things
Scurrying, loving, breeding, dying.
I remember those things, distantly.
I don't miss the mud and blood and shit
And I wonder why they treasure them.
Let me show you something greater, mortal.
Open those extra eyes
That nobody told you about
And see all that choice can offer.

## The High Priestess

When the heavens call, pick up.
The line might scream with static
But that's hardly unusual.
I just nod and note, asking calmly,
What is the path between? Howling.
What is the truth beyond life? Roaring.
But there's plenty the heavens don't know.
When I ask, how to enlighten my peers
The line goes quiet.
It's always up to us mortals
To fill in the details.

## The Three of Swords

I didn't know a heart could break like that.
You found me in the wild green,
And I found you naked, body and soul.
You invited me in, and we opened flowers
Like you opened my mind.
By the end of seven days, I was someone different.
The unkempt grasses of my homeland
Now pricked the feet you had washed so soft.
So you said, go to the people.
Love is a promise that lives in you.
Through all of us, we give it form.

## The Three of Wands

Look far, little one.
The cliffside dwarfs your tall stature,
But the borrowed height grants such sight
Over such far reaches, and all it teaches
Gives you pause with the weight of the cause.
A journey of a thousand steps starts with one
So set off while you can, in the daylight at dawn
And maybe you'll arive while you're still alive.

## The Three of Cups

They call it guestright, and it starts at the gates.
Hungry, stranger? Feast from the harvest, kept in the stores!
Thirsty, my dear? Slake thy parch with the river's bounty.
A sort of journey ends when we meet,
And in our joy glows our reprieve.
Step beyond the threshold of mirth,
Step into our City of Civilized Delights.
I sing with you when you sing with me,
And together our harmony deepens.

## The Three of Pentacles

Civilization takes work, they say. But whose?
Everyone's, they say. But who's that?
They see my strength and they give me a chisel,
But they don't trust my wits, so they watch.
Together we're smarter than we are alone, they say.
I like when that's true,
But it's only my hands that grow calluses.

## The Empress

We call it the Duarchy, and I'm just one half.
My syndicates tame rivers and leash mountains,
So the green grows where we tell it to,
And beasts know we hold power over their death.
I preside with my partner, and our love is empire.
Creation creates the creator; to parent necessitates progeny.
They call me fertile, but all I raise is possibility.
They call me soft, but when one stays the gravity of famine
One cannot help but know intimately its tearing edge.

## The Emperor

We call it the Duarchy, and I'm the other half.
My forces march against our enemies, such as they are.
Not the weather, not the seasons, not the stars or seas,
But the foolhardy violence of my peers and cousins.
The slaver's hand can be turned
Even when it means breaking the arm,
And once you hear that bone snap enough times,
You stop feeling like there's a person around it.
We raise walls to stay the hordes,
But who's a horde is just a matter of allegiance.

## The Four of Swords

The pact of mortality is death.
Many things that never live will never die,
But we have the privilege to perish.
All our struggles leave us lying still in state,
Their consequences to be considered by our survivors alone.
Mind what you sacrifice, stranger; mind what you give to empire.
They might give you a grand tomb,
But you won't survive to appreciate it.

## The Four of Wands

Welcome, stranger. Welcome home.
We dance in the daylight and we drink into the night.
Poetry flows from loose lips; in vino veritas.
We dine on cornucopia and thank by name its gatherers.
We frolic on stones laid by the work of neighbors.
Now whose eye do you catch? In what pupil do you sparkle?
Even royalty can fall in love; decorum cannot prevent attraction.
Let our joy sanctify compassion.
Let our mirth reach the stars.

## The Four of Cups

I have it good, or good enough, I think.
It's not perfect, not by a long shot,
But guestright is alright, here in the City.
I'm housed and fed, and a healer's never far.
I don't know how to feel when that handsome one looks my way.
I don't know what to think of everything that separates us.
The wild cultivated courage in me,
But in his gaze my bashfulness feels like cowardice.
What do I turn away from
When my blush draws my eyes to the ground?

## The Four of Pentacles

Authority requires control. It is control.
Our enemies march. They covet our City.
Through shrewd brutality, they can be cowed,
But what spirit do I nurture through war?
The wildman covets nothing, is nothing but himself,
While for the sake of peace, I am little but the mask
Of decorum, of empire, of a violent unity
Whose pax is broken deviants.
Is it I that is shrewd now, as I wield brutality?
Or something alien that moves through me
Which cares nothing for the love we claim to protect?

## The Hierophant

You cannot do that here. It is forbidden.
The Duarchy has rules, you outsider.
We grant you our kindness, but we don't have to,
And if you betray it, as I see you betray it,
Then you will find instead a cold, cold absence.
We choose a higher covenant than prey and predator,
The likes of which made you in chaos and blood.
It's unruly. Even our enemies have nations,
But you have only... so much reeking hair.
Do not approach the throne, outsider.
You should know better.

## The Lovers

We find each other in the dark
Where only our fingers can see our faces,
And our lips speak without words
In soft touches, firm grace, and hungry passion.
It doesn't matter who we are in the daylight,
What strictures separate our worlds.
All of civilization is a story we tell
Inbetween the only real things in life,
The things our bodies feel.
If empire cannot survive how we feel together,
Then maybe it deserves to crumble.

## The Five of Swords

When we scatter their legions,
The survivors walk to our gates
And become our latest citizens.
Nomads and traders and crows all scavenge,
And the profits trickle to our bazaars.
The battle does not quell animosity.
The strength of our walls does not change
That they will come again, and again.
For now, we watch their generals walk away
Unlike so many of their loyal guard,
Because we are merciful, stranger,
But mercy doesn't keep you safe.

## The Five of Wands

They present me with a weapon,
Long and sharp and borne of killing dreams.
You will need this, they say.
You will need to know how to use it.
I ask, but why?
War lives in the human spirit, they reply,
Before they show me how to hit a dummy.
The weapon's shaft thuds against straw flesh;
They don't tell me how different it is,
The sound when the flesh is thinking meat.

## The Five of Cups

What have I lost in the City?
I made a friend of a bailiff,
Who died on a rival people's spear-point.
My neighbors know me by name now,
But that name is always: stranger.
I carved the walls of the newest temple,
But only the priests get the credit.
I may have some things of unalloyed good,
But even the love that makes me glow
Is a secret to his court.
What have I lost in the City?
Was it worth it?

## The Five of Pentacles

The wounded don't simply die.
They suffer.
They wander a world no longer for them.
It considers their each breath a mercy,
However shallow, however pained.
After the battle is won,
The human cost takes a long toll,
But empire can imagine nothing for them,
Nothing more compassionate
Than another pained and shallow breath.
What kindness can it not conceive?
What compassion escapes its rigid order?

## The Chariot

We ride!
Our foes gather like wasps;
I go to scatter them. Will you attend me?
You have seen them assault the gates.
You have seen how they covet the City.
I need your strong arm and wild wits
Like my armies need my governance
For together, we are unstoppable.
Triumph is summoned, not destined;
The ritual of effort evokes victory.
Fight with me, my strange lover,
And I promise I will see you again.

## The Six of Swords

Hush now, if you know what matters.
The times, they are a-changing
By the hands of courageous rivals --
our hands, your Lady.
You may not want to go,
Nor to take your most cherished away,
But this is how we hate each other.
It's more than my nation wanting your City.
We want to paint its walls with our droppings
In the artistic ways of our superior culture.
If you come with us now, we will let you live.
Your Duarchal husband will come for you,
and then we will have it all.

## The Six of Wands

The many fight as one
In the practiced ways of our storied ranks,
But particularly when one tells them to.
When I call them to bravery,
They answer with confidence.
But when I doubt,
They smell it like piss.
I trust who calls me in or out,
Whoever has the bravery for that,
Because a sycophant can never be trusted.
When we stand together,
No one falls.
But, if someone has to,
How could I do less than volunteer?

## The Six of Cups

I dreamed about us, lover.
I dreamed about a home that didn't raise me,
One with pillows and baked bread.
You were there, an itching youth like me,
And we dug in the mud for fun,
Thinking someday we'd dig aqueducts.
Lover, what is an aqueduct?
In the wild, I drink from the good streams,
And the City has its sacred fountains --
Is that how they work?
Maybe I might have known that,
If I had been born somehow different.
Imagine if we had known each other
Longer.

## The Six of Pentacles

Kneel, and I'll grant you a fair deal.
You stood against the City, and we beat you.
Your lords took her. Where is she?
Now, look -- everyone has a price,
And we're all just following orders, right?
So maybe I fill your hands,
And you stand down and divulge,
And when then is all over,
We call it square.
Now I ask you again:
Where is she?

## Strength

The prison fell without a fight.
It was all over, by then.
She walked out shaken, but in one piece.
The guards weren't even a problem,
Except the ones who became a problem,
And we City-folk, we solve problems.
The bards will say it was destiny, like the weather,
But the truth is more like the cleverness of a crow.
The opportunistic leap, the scavenger's creativity --
Step into the vacuum that floats like a wave
Sucked between the systems of time and space
And the systems of communal human effect
Like a rip-tide.
Unready, you might drown,
But the boat-buoyed sailor floats to sea
While my navy navigates home.

## The Seven of Swords

You can fight without weapons, I realize,
And by virtue of your eminent skill, you'll still win.
But you can't fight where you aren't,
And you can't fight while you sleep.
You'll hate the gift of the wine,
And the truth in its tannins will prove too much.
The tragedy of hierarchy is always the heart,
That it beats alone, central and essential.
When it stops, the show stops,
And your government falls.
Heirs, advisors, and courtiers may quibble for the remains,
And the name of your realm will be passed on tattered
Like the chew toy of a dozen hungry dogs.
But, only if you're the one that drinks the wine...

## The Seven of Wands

They came while you were away, my monarchs.
We stood our ground, but couldn't hold it.
Their unfathomable ambitions produced devices
Hurling rock and burning oil.
Falling masonry, screams of the burning dead --
It won't go away, my monarchs. It's been days.
It's been days since they occupied the City.
They took apart their artillery to patch the walls.
We can still win, of course. Can't we?
I suppose it isn't up to me,
However much I'll be called to realize it.

## The Seven of Cups

There isn't just one future, of course.
We summon our destiny with our deeds,
And the spirit only acts by choice.
But what choices are these?
I have been faithful. How can you vex me so?
To trade my most loyal for my own home?
Or to give it up, and return to nomad ways?
There's no shame in being the wandering shepherd.
They range the reaches we can't govern,
And trade us milk and wool for cheese and cloth
In the market we used to have.
I think I had a nomad ancestor,
Only a few generations back.
Six or seven, maybe.
What am I thinking? I've never known
But fountains and bread and books,
And I don't intend to soon.
I'd rather cut off my own head
Than trade of my herd in their bazaar.
But,
Maybe that's exactly what I'll have to do.

## The Seven of Pentacles

The first lesson you learn in my civil corps?
Reap what you sow. You always will; you always do.
We planted the City, a long time ago maybe, like a tree,
But we make it every day we live it, because it's not a place.
It's us, and how we choose to live.
We might have inherited our ways,
Been privileged to see them set in stone
Even for a while,
But they are still our ways, even unlanded.
Our ancestors sowed secrets, and today they bear fruit.
The occupier doesn't know the dirt like we do,
And our wandering rivers don't know their names.
Step lightly into the hidden belly,
And lift back to life everything we made.

## The Hermit

It isn't my city, is it?
It's the City. I just used to live there.
You can't ask me to give of myself like this.
I'm not from here. Your peers call me outsider.
What home can I have, even in your arms?
Your embrace returns to her, obligated,
But with what passion? Passion like ours?
I don't want to gamble in your sewers
For a chance to whimper in your shadow.
I want to lay with you now, while she's away,
While the candles burn and the pillows have feathers.
I want to taste the wine on your lips
Like no animal can.

## The Wheel of Fortune

You hesitated. Why? Oh.
Oh no.
It doesn't feel right.
I've rolled unseemly dice
And they've landed all wrong.
Some strange transmutation writhes in me.
What have you done? What have I done?
No. Who has done this to us?
Fate calls in such strange ways.
Up sometimes, down all the others, huh?
Prey and predator's not worse than this,
This covenant of a higher barbarism.
It could have been either of us, lover.
I suppose I'm glad it was me.

## The Eight of Swords

There had been a traitor, naturally.
To call him a rat would dishonor the rodent.
He's baking in the sun and the mud now,
And that's fine by me today.
The wounded lie in tents, a numerous cacaphony.
But, by their struggle, the City is ours again.
A conspiracy, a faction's aspiring duo --
They're all dead now, of course.
I had higher hopes for them. We used to drink together.
But I've seen what happens when you trust a drink,
And I wanted worse for them than what they gave.
I wanted from them the weight of all they took,
And it sufficed to take it in blood.

## The Eight of Wands

The campaign comes to a close.
The heroes get medals. The maimed get pensions.
The survivors go home. The banished go away.
There's still so much to do --
Just look at how they've defaced our temples --
But at least we're home now.
At least I can send the wildman a proper doctor,
Something for the pain,
Something for the anguish.
In his old home, he'd already be dead.
I wonder if my mercy is kinder.

## The Eight of Cups

I turn my back.
I can hardly look at you like this.
You gibber now, yearning and sickly.
What would I want from you?
I won't send the doctor away,
But I won't be back soon.
I feel things when you look at me --
Eyes sunken, skin sallow, lips quivering --
That I can't stand to feel.
Everything we had is empty now.
Nothing is forever, not even in a life.
I'm sorry we had so little.
I'm sorry I didn't have more.

## The Eight of Pentacles

Work hard, and it'll work out.
That's what the Teacher says, anyway.
Every lesson sticks to the avid student,
And though months may pass rebuilding,
Every day contains a unique discovery.
The Teacher speaks loose, speaking ill:
The Duarchy lags today, don't they?
Their court is sundered, working us overtime
To patch the holes of their incompetence.
A wiser Duarchy wouldn't have faced such a trap,
As the wise artisans conceive the proper tool
While their lessers toil primitively.
No work does not require skill,
So the unskilled suffer from ignorance.
We don't need ignorance here. We have skill.
The Student nods, chiseling away.
They have no reply, but the message settles
Into a nest in their mind
To be repeated without thinking
Just as it was spoken.

## Justice

I am sorry. I owed you my love in the daylight.
I proclaim it so: a plaza of your name,
To honor your kindness, curiosity, and sacrifice.
It will be cold comfort when you are gone,
But in the springs to come,
The blossoms will remind me of you.
Bees will wriggle into petals,
And I will think of you
When you were more than dying.
The pact of mortality is death,
Though we never quite know its nature
Until it's too late to tell.
This recognition may end my reign,
But I hope it brings us peace.

## The Hanged Man

Lover, I must tell you what will come.
No, what has happened...!
I dreamed -- I dreamed so furiously.
Down in the earth lies a temple
Of carved stone turned wet and slick and green
By the moist aquifier hardly meters below.
I've never liked caves, not the ones that go so deep.
Things live there, lover. Things like birds with hands
That clutch at the moss and clay, and devour,
Hungry for such a bare crop. Hungry forever.
Listen, lover. It's where I'm going.
Find me, if you can.
I wandered the dim halls, glowing with ghostlight.
Etched glyphs faded to soft depressions;
If I wrote them, could you read them?
I can't read, lover. I still can't.
I saw this one on the forehead
Of a too-long obsidian woman, garbed in jade and emerald.
She sneered from her black throne -- at me, lover.
"Who are you?" she demanded. She stood so tall.
Her presence swept away the light like night.
I had no lips with which to answer. The dead have no bodies.
But I woke up screaming.
What is her name in your heavens?
Of course, of course. Queen of the underworld.
How do you think I knew her sign? A coincidence?
I'll die soon, lover.
It's no coincidence where I'm going.

## The Nine of Swords

Life isn't bad, out of power.
My walls glitter with my trophies,
And my bones creak with the years.
I don't have to worry who sees my back ache;
That's the new Duarchy's problem now.
Me and the old lady, we still live together,
But it's colder than I'd like.
I wake up to those trophies like weights on my chest,
The burden of decades like inertia, like momentum,
Like a destiny beyond my control,
Like a realm I no longer govern.
She's happy enough, the new vizier,
The wisest of wormtongues, the queen of thorns.
I always did love her for that. Ambitious like the asp.
But mainly, I think of you.
Mainly, I think of you and cry.

## The Nine of Wands

What if I didn't give up?
What if my mistakes didn't win?
What if I kept fighting
Even on my death-bed?
What if I told Death no,
And she listened?
I'm coughing blood now;
The doctor feeds and bathes me.
Did the assassin want this for you?
Good thing I'm the stronger one.
You City-folk are as pretty as lillies,
And about as frail.

## The Nine of Cups

The new Duarchy has a benefactor in the bazaar.
The Lady may control the corps, the Lord his armies,
But it's really trade that stocks the storehouse,
And a hungering thing's first foe is always hunger.
The nine outer tribes obey the monopolist's writ;
His caravans favor them, and happen to favor us.
While grain is cheap and plentiful, who complains?
The cart that rolls doesn't need to be fixed,
Even when it depends on a single weak axle.
It won't be a problem for a while yet,
Not for a lifetime at least,
And by then the monopolist won't care.
He'll be dead.

## The Nine of Pentacles

Consequences echo, and sometimes they rhyme.
The City prospers again, with its cold and calculated compassion.
There is enough for everyone, so long as enough is enough.
When you said there's too little, you just needed too much.
Eat your fill, and it will fill you;
Suck on faith to stave the hunger.
We didn't salt the earth, that isn't why it spoils.
The salt is very clever, you see. The spoil is your fault.
We bicker to distract from famine, like it were bread.
All good things come to an end,
And we're never quite wise enough for cleverness,
Are we?
But we had a good thing,
Didn't we?

## Death

Lover, come close. Join me at the threshold now.
Everything changes. Nothing happens twice, really.
It's always different, everything, everywhere.
But, in your memories, I can be preserved,
Our little time elongated with each reverie.
Will you hold me there still?
And when I return to soil,
Will the wealth of my body become your fecund harvest?
I hope so.
I never got to cook you dinner,
But maybe I can feed your progeny.
Then, someday, perhaps,
I will see you again.
Everything changes,
And very little isn't possible.
Lover, come close,
For the last time.

## Temperance

It's quiet, afterwards.
He's faded from my eyes, which I can hardly recall.
The taste of his kiss echoes like the patter of rain,
Fading, fading, fading, as the sky clears.
I'm not bothered by forgetting, I realize.
It feels like peace. Then I realize nothing.
Nothing is all that remains of me,
Except this mote, floating, wondering,
Recalling vaguely some of what I might have been,
And some of who I will be, and what I was before all that.
It blurs together, doesn't it?
But it doesn't feel bad. It doesn't hurt anymore.
I feel total tranquility.
It feels like nothing.

## The Ten of Swords

A corpse is only beautiful from a strange perspective.
It deflates, in the moment. Relaxing in his arms.
Tears are not enough. They are never really enough.
Grief touched eternity. He thinks of loving him forever,
But of course,
His dearest friend is already gone.
What would he care about his body now?
Well, his dearest friend sure does.
We return to soil with rituals
(And his all mean love)
But it's the soil that's alive.
All we do is return.

## The Ten of Wands

My deeds are so heavy. I have accrued so many,
Over such a fatiguing trip.
Born beyond and without, innocent in the green,
I tripped and travelled and travailed;
I tricked and trapped and triumphed.
Now they're just this burden
But for where I'm going, I suppose.
There I'll make use of all I've prepared --
Right?
What if I took a rest,
If I laid down a staff or two,
Forgot where I'd placed them,
And went on lighter?
Surely not, surely not --
Surely...

## The Ten of Cups

Look, a rainbow. Let's make a wish.
I wish he was still alive.
I wish he could see the daylight.
I wish you, my child, all the happiness in the world,
And my Empress all the love I failed to realize,
However much or little I tried while I could.
Parents and children do not share fates,
However much or little we try while we can,
So I wish something different for you,
And I know it will be granted,
However much or little of it I will see.

## The Ten of Pentacles

Royal descendants tend to live well,
While someone recognizes their royalty.
Someone important, of course, of an important City,
While that City remains important,
And for generations, several at least, it does.
The hubris of privilege can be a slow poison,
But it doubtless is toxic.
Not even the land would survive it, in the end.
I didn't live to see it, of course,
But after my eyes closed for the last time,
I saw it all, to the end,
And the wealth was nothing there.

## The Devil

Brother, it is good to see you again.
I missed you in the green, where you left me.
You were always so hairless for a boar,
But we called you family and you earned it.
You wouldn't take of the clan, though,
And that priestess -- she took you.
Remember? Remember leaving us behind?
We died to hunters. They ate in the temple-hall
Where you chiseled murals.
-- Hahaha! What faces I can wear.
Do you like it? When I'm like who you've loved?
Maybe I can try another -- you protest!
Oh no, no, my dear and darling once-alive,
You don't get to say no this time.
Corpses say nothing, and yours rotted away.

## The Tower

Even gods can be defied,
And death has a palette
For more than just the living.
It's a great trial indeed:
Great laid stones fall away as you step;
Walls thought unbreakable, shatter and crumble;
Even the sky expresses its disfavor,
For it is the heavens you seek to assault.
When they come for you,
Unless you rise to the task,
You'll perish in the rubble,
Screaming much too long.
So I thought I'd strike first,
Tear by tooth if I must, the fabric of fate.
It's a tough weave,
But the green gave me sharp canines.

## The Page of Swords

Eternity awaits. Life just happens along the way.
Step lively into the cracks of the before
And the after, too, for it is all cracked.
The Creator is Creation, and it is just like us:
Flawed, temperamental -- of personality.
So like a neighbor, I hope we'll be friends,
But the real is always more alien than you expect.
It can surprise you,
No matter your wisdom.
It can sate you,
No matter your curiosity.

## The Page of Wands

How can you get anywhere quickly in forever?
You can get anywhere if you take forever,
And now I've got nothing but forever.
There's nothing in my life that I had never,
That isn't lying on an infinity beyond never.
I could read it to the end, but it ends in never,
The only thing you can't find in forever.

## The Page of Cups

Belief lives in the heart,
A home that lives in you, powers you,
And dies with you --
Or does it?
Does it come to you
Because you are alive? No --
Maybe I know that now.
Maybe it comes from somewhere that isn't alive.
What could it think, that thinks like us
Without a heart like ours?
A heart like I had.

## The Page of Pentacles

Sometimes I get a glimpse
Of something like being alive again.
I recall a feeling like a gust of wind,
A place or person or predicament of some past,
Maybe mine, or maybe someone I was;
Like remembering a story I'd overheard
From the inside.
I bet I could find a way there, if I tried.
Stories aren't so different from prophecies,
Not if we really try.
I think I want to try;
I'm ready to see what happens.

## The Star

Did the heavens create us to find them?
Not to die, to meet them afterwards,
But to seek them in their ineffable forms?
We live in contradiction and duality,
Their bond as unbreakable as the sky,
As assured as dawn or dusk.
It shouldn't work at all, should it?
Yet it is the only thing
We have ever seen work.
If even it seems unthinkable now,
Then what else can our minds grasp
When they live in the unthinkable?

## The Knight of Swords

The covenant of prey and predator
Was not inevitable or self-evident.
In an entropic universe, radiating decay,
There is plenty of rot with which to grow life,
And it does not always find cause to self-consume,
Though it usually does.
It tends to eventually discover
It is much easier to take what is whole
Than to grow from a seed,
But the cycle always begins with one.

## The Knight of Wands

Ho there! I am the promise of the City,
At long last come to aid you.
You have been to my place above the ground,
Now welcome to it below.
The villains of wild and weather assail you!
They are no match for my clever tools
And my drive to employ them.
Take my hand, come away with me.
I'll teach you to read, this time,
And you can use it against our enemies.

## The Knight of Cups

When all else falls away, there we are,
Naked, alone with the fact of us.
I don't want to return to biting and sweating,
Tearing from flesh with my overgrown bones
And calling it delicious.
Is that who I was? Is that who I wanted to be?
How can who I want to be, be outside of me,
When it came from me?
Is it my child?
Then let me show it adoration over disappointment,
Kindness and understanding, more than judgment,
And the grace to be not quite enough.

## The Knight of Pentacles

I garb myself in what I have,
And here it's fractions of ignorance.
When the thing you become spans forever,
It's a luxury to know less than everything.
It's all the rage, all the fashion, among the deathless,
Because it reminds them of having been, even just the once,
And lets those who never were, play pretend.
It's practical garb, at least.
How better to hide something
Than to forget it?

## The Moon

I'm sorry, but there is no return from neverwhere.
You can yap all you want, but it only vibrates the air.
Hear though I may, you can't make me care.
By my design, I made things this way.
You live in shadows because that's what I say,
And you laugh at them for my amusement.
It's complicated, so let me give you a hint,
Because you fought so hard to understand it.
Now you're too deep to back out,
And what you've done has chosen your route.

## The Queen of Swords

Maybe there isn't really life after death;
That's alright. I'm still here, now,
Somehow --
I remain this mote, this little nothing,
That doesn't quite feel nothing.
I've left so many marks on existence,
Spun so many things into being,
Things that whirl far beyond my passing.
I miss being the seed of them all,
Coherent and messy, whole and broken, all at once --
But I can't let it hold me back,
This specter of what isn't anymore.
There's something else out there,
Something very much like nothing,
Something my little nothing seeks.

## The Queen of Wands

Those pesky mortals and their remnants here
Flit like flies and buzz like bugs.
They waltz right in, reeking of life,
Dripping all over eternity's regal carpets,
Viscera and memory and grief and want.
It makes me nauseous,
When it doesn't make me jealous.
Our radiance caused the fabric upon which they fester,
Where they fight and fuck and forget,
And never wholly appreciate what they so briefly have --
What we cannot.
We know everything, and can never forget.
We exist forever, but are never alive.
We feel nothing, and have witnessed everything.
It's a pale shadow of their vivacious being,
To wrap their remains around my countless digits,
But in a drought without an end --
The drought at the end of time --
Then any water will slake a ceaseless thirst.

## The Queen of Cups

It's enough to have everything, isn't it?
It's not just anything, unfortunately --
It's always more than you want,
And never what you had in mind.
It's never something specific,
And when you have something specifically,
It becomes a part of you, and the absence too
Of everything it isn't.
That's beautiful, I think -- don't you agree?
It should be protected, and savored,
Even when those chosen to have it
Resent the burden they never requested.
Even their resentment is something,
And all the somethings in everything
Are the same kind of sacred.

## The Queen of Pentacles

I cannot let you go, little morsel.
You must leave your essence with me
If you wish to press on.
I hunger for it. See, my drool drips.
It isn't so much to ask, is it?
Or so much to give, at this late hour?
I can help you fit beyond the gate,
To squeeze key-like through the lock,
Because without this last piece of you,
You will soon be everything.
Don't worry about what you'll miss,
Or what will become impossible to you.
Your new form will span all possibility,
To touch all things, all at once, forever,
Beyond the likes of pain and fear --
And only what you give me
Will mind my chewing.

## The Sun

Dawn begins each day,
But dawn never ends, either.
It just races around the planet,
Over and over and over again.
Its sweeping gaze heralds life and death
And the decay that fuels them both.
I am born again in its light, as its light,
Sweeping and sweeping, formless and warm,
Weightless and incomparable, a miracle
From which all to observe miracles do rise.
What does light think, I wonder?
I wonder, and realize how heavy I remain.
What astounding forms our bodies take,
Even here, far beyond flesh.

## The King of Swords

You recognize me --
Or you think you do.
Isn't it marvelous, to think at all?
I resemble him, don't I?
Younger, fuller-faced, the youth
Before the weather wore him down
And you fell for every wrinkle.
All authority resembles itself,
From the fabric of reality
To the grip of a lover
And the bite of a foe.
The mind cuts like steel,
Slicing through time's waters
A trout with the current,
Never a salmon against.
The closest you can come, little one,
Is to be the cold blue itself.

## The King of Wands

You miss the body, don't you?
The flesh that summoned you,
The womb-grown form, spilled in the green,
Teeth-torn umbilical and hushed infant cries.
Remember? Of course you don't.
The hand you flex belongs to a ghost;
The hand you had decays in the dirt.
The animal commanded the spirit,
However much your waking life disagreed.
You were its tool -- just another organ,
However alien the you-of-you proves.
That is why you stand before me now, little mote.
It needed you to live and live again,
But you don't need the body, not really.
You exist here, formless and eternal;
You always did, and you always will.
But you miss the body, don't you?
You always will.

## The King of Cups

The cup that overflowed, is empty
And all the ground goes flooded.
We pour endless of ourselves
Yet prove no deeper than droplets
Swallowed by the ravenous sea.
Witness this wet eternity
Replete with souls and remnants
Flowing like liquid colors,
Vibrant streams and oil slicks
Superficially differentiated
In an undivided ocean.
How different were you, ever?
How different could you be
When you arose from the same waters
As all that would ever be?

## The King of Pentacles

Isn't the Emerald Green rich, little mote?
You've wandered its reaches long and deep,
And come near now to its strangest edge --
The closest thing it has to an end.
Verdancy swallows us, however fleshless:
Life upon life, through life, despite life;
Death beyond death, before death, without death.
These spaceless places teem relentless!
What a fleeting privilege, to want anything at all.
All your possessions devour you, in the end
And even your bones leave you behind.
Then you will have nothing.
Then you will be like us.
Then you will be everything.

## Judgement

Rise! And face me,
The last face you'll ever see.
Hear! And listen well,
The only sound to follow death's knell.
Place your remains upon my scale
And suffer the wages of a winter gale:
Cold and frigid, clean and pure.
I judge you sufficient, enough to endure,
Or not enough to weather the storm
That reduces to nothing your remnant form.
Rise! And face me,
The last burden before you're free.

## The Ace of Swords

Wherever there is one thing,
Now there are two.
I divide you, piece into pieces.
Things into parts; symbols into referents.
The unity of the universe crumbles
Before the poetry of its own patterns.
The rock never perceives its wholeness,
Nor pebbles, how they form when it shatters,
But the living do witness.
They witness with eyes that distinguish,
They witness with swords that disfigure,
They witness with hammers that destroy,
Until death disarms them.
So disarmed, so reduced, you arrive,
Little mote: what can you distinguish now?

## The Ace of Wands

The seed sprouts after the fire,
Sending tentative limbs into the ash,
Hungry and curious.
It grows in the daylight,
And flourishes in the rain.
It rises and rises, soft green giving way
To tough brown bark, rough and durable.
The traveler plucks a branch, strips it,
And calls it a staff -- a wand.
The seedling's stuff grown sturdy,
Steadying the journey, easing the path.
The tree travels in this way, sightless
And still, nevertheless, worldly.
The tree will never know the branch again,
But they all return to soil
Where knowledge goes to rest.
