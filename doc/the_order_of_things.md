# The Order of Things

## The Fool

I begin each day,
But neither is sunset an end.
My arrivals compound everywhere I go,
And I go where I damn please.
No door can stay the intrepid;
No lock, the curious.
The wild green lives in me,
And it blossoms with every dream.

## The Two of Swords

Intuition pulls like the moon sometimes, doesn't it?
It tugs on your guts like a new kind of north.
You have to stay steady not just to stay the course,
But to listen to the earth under you, inside of you,
To hear what moves ahead.

## The Two of Wands

You already have so much, you think to yourself sometimes.
Why want more?
My goodness -- why not?
There's so much out there to see and feel and touch and be!
I could be anyone, eventually. Anything.
Why not go a-looking, then?
Let's see what fate has in store!

## The Two of Cups

Who now do I find?
What an offer -- what a trade.
I look at the thundering clouds,
the forest bending before the gale,
and think the same words they say to me:
"We can only get through this together."
So we do. We make it through.
What an offer. What a trade.

## The Two of Pentacles

My two cents? Balance in all things.
Accounts balance, loves balance,
And everything that falls apart
Is just finding a new balance.
It's deft to dance in the midst,
Because the balance you try to hold
Differs from decay's indifference.

## The Magician

Look at all the little things
Scurrying, loving, breeding, dying.
I remember those things, distantly.
I don't miss the mud and blood and shit
And I wonder why they treasure them.
Let me show you something greater, mortal.
Open those extra eyes
That nobody told you about
And see all that choice can offer.

## The High Priestess

When the heavens call, pick up.
The line might scream with static
But that's hardly unusual.
I just nod and note, asking calmly,
What is the path between? Howling.
What is the truth beyond life? Roaring.
But there's plenty the heavens don't know.
When I ask, how to enlighten my peers
The line goes quiet.
It's always up to us mortals
To fill in the details.

## The Three of Swords

I didn't know a heart could break like that.
You found me in the wild green,
And I found you naked, body and soul.
You invited me in, and we opened flowers
Like you opened my mind.
By the end of seven days, I was someone different.
The unkempt grasses of my homeland
Now pricked the feet you had washed so soft.
So you said, go to the people.
Love is a promise that lives in you.
Through all of us, we give it form.

## The Three of Wands

Look far, little one.
The cliffside dwarfs your tall stature,
But the borrowed height grants such sight
Over such far reaches, and all it teaches
Gives you pause with the weight of the cause.
A journey of a thousand steps starts with one
So set off while you can, in the daylight at dawn
And maybe you'll arive while you're still alive.

## The Three of Cups

They call it guestright, and it starts at the gates.
Hungry, stranger? Feast from the harvest, kept in the stores!
Thirsty, my dear? Slake thy parch with the river's bounty.
A sort of journey ends when we meet,
And in our joy glows our reprieve.
Step beyond the threshold of mirth,
Step into our City of Civilized Delights.
I sing with you when you sing with me,
And together our harmony deepens.

## The Three of Pentacles

Civilization takes work, they say. But whose?
Everyone's, they say. But who's that?
They see my strength and they give me a chisel,
But they don't trust my wits, so they watch.
Together we're smarter than we are alone, they say.
I like when that's true,
But it's only my hands that grow calluses.

## The Empress

We call it the Duarchy, and I'm just one half.
My syndicates tame rivers and leash mountains,
So the green grows where we tell it to,
And beasts know we hold power over their death.
I preside with my partner, and our love is empire.
Creation creates the creator; to parent necessitates progeny.
They call me fertile, but all I raise is possibility.
They call me soft, but when one stays the gravity of famine
One cannot help but know intimately its tearing edge.

## The Emperor

We call it the Duarchy, and I'm the other half.
My forces march against our enemies, such as they are.
Not the weather, not the seasons, not the stars or seas,
But the foolhardy violence of my peers and cousins.
The slaver's hand can be turned
Even when it means breaking the arm,
And once you hear that bone snap enough times,
You stop feeling like there's a person around it.
We raise walls to stay the hordes,
But who's a horde is just a matter of allegiance.

## The Four of Swords

The pact of mortality is death.
Many things that never live will never die,
But we have the privilege to perish.
All our struggles leave us lying still in state,
Their consequences to be considered by our survivors alone.
Mind what you sacrifice, stranger; mind what you give to empire.
They might give you a grand tomb,
But you won't survive to appreciate it.

## The Four of Wands

Welcome, stranger. Welcome home.
We dance in the daylight and we drink into the night.
Poetry flows from loose lips; in vino veritas.
We dine on cornucopia and thank by name its gatherers.
We frolic on stones laid by the work of neighbors.
Now whose eye do you catch? In what pupil do you sparkle?
Even royalty can fall in love; decorum cannot prevent attraction.
Let our joy sanctify compassion.
Let our mirth reach the stars.

## The Four of Cups

I have it good, or good enough, I think.
It's not perfect, not by a long shot,
But guestright is alright, here in the City.
I'm housed and fed, and a healer's never far.
I don't know how to feel when that handsome one looks my way.
I don't know what to think of everything that separates us.
The wild cultivated courage in me,
But in his gaze my bashfulness feels like cowardice.
What do I turn away from
When my blush draws my eyes to the ground?

## The Four of Pentacles

Authority requires control. It is control.
Our enemies march. They covet our City.
Through shrewd brutality, they can be cowed,
But what spirit do I nurture through war?
The wildman covets nothing, is nothing but himself,
While for the sake of peace, I am little but the mask
Of decorum, of empire, of a violent unity
Whose pax is broken deviants.
Is it I that is shrewd now, as I wield brutality?
Or something alien that moves through me
Which cares nothing for the love we claim to protect?

## The Hierophant

You cannot do that here. It is forbidden.
The Duarchy has rules, you outsider.
We grant you our kindness, but we don't have to,
And if you betray it, as I see you betray it,
Then you will find instead a cold, cold absence.
We choose a higher covenant than prey and predator,
The likes of which made you in chaos and blood.
It's unruly. Even our enemies have nations,
But you have only... so much reeking hair.
Do not approach the throne, outsider.
You should know better.

## The Lovers

We find each other in the dark
Where only our fingers can see our faces,
And our lips speak without words
In soft touches, firm grace, and hungry passion.
It doesn't matter who we are in the daylight,
What strictures separate our worlds.
All of civilization is a story we tell
Inbetween the only real things in life,
The things our bodies feel.
If empire cannot survive how we feel together,
Then maybe it deserves to crumble.

## The Five of Swords

When we scatter their legions,
The survivors walk to our gates
And become our latest citizens.
Nomads and traders and crows all scavenge,
And the profits trickle to our bazaars.
The battle does not quell animosity.
The strength of our walls does not change
That they will come again, and again.
For now, we watch their generals walk away
Unlike so many of their loyal guard,
Because we are merciful, stranger,
But mercy doesn't keep you safe.

## The Five of Wands

They present me with a weapon,
Long and sharp and borne of killing dreams.
You will need this, they say.
You will need to know how to use it.
I ask, but why?
War lives in the human spirit, they reply,
Before they show me how to hit a dummy.
The weapon's shaft thuds against straw flesh;
They don't tell me how different it is,
The sound when the flesh is thinking meat.

## The Five of Cups

What have I lost in the City?
I made a friend of a bailiff,
Who died on a rival people's spear-point.
My neighbors know me by name now,
But that name is always: stranger.
I carved the walls of the newest temple,
But only the priests get the credit.
I may have some things of unalloyed good,
But even the love that makes me glow
Is a secret to his court.
What have I lost in the City?
Was it worth it?

## The Five of Pentacles

The wounded don't simply die.
They suffer.
They wander a world no longer for them.
It considers their each breath a mercy,
However shallow, however pained.
After the battle is won,
The human cost takes a long toll,
But empire can imagine nothing for them,
Nothing more compassionate
Than another pained and shallow breath.
What kindness can they not conceive?
What compassion escapes their rigid order?
