*The Emerald Green* is a tabletop roleplaying game that you play with using a 78-card Tarot deck, such as the Rider-Waite deck or the Tarot of Marseilles (but not the Thoth deck), instead of dice. You play as a person that has entered into a fae pact, that grants you powers, and consumes you. It is intended for use in high fantasy settings similar to the worlds of Faerun or Golarion, where gods are real, and alien.

Players build characters by first *exiling* three cards from their deck, and then *sanctifying* two. Exiled cards are permanently removed (you can always restore them after the session; your character sheet keeps track) but sanctified cards act as exiled but are allowed to remain in the deck. Characters gain traits based on what cards are missing from their deck, whose effects range from increased health or luck, to experience-shaping powers and covenants. You do not pick which traits you gain. You choose what to exile, and the consequences happen whether you want them or not.

Other highlights:

- You play with a hand of cards, shuffling and drawing at the start of each in-game day. Choose how you respond to challenges by applying one or more cards, discarding them from your hand.
- Challenges may call for responses of a certain sort. Specific suits, odds or evens, major or minor arcana, etc.; failure to respond in kind can be punishing.
- Your character's traits are derived from what cards are absent from your deck. Each time you level up, you discard another card, which bequeaths every trait which then matches the cards missing from your deck.
