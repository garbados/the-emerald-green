# Introduction

> **You had never dreamed so furiously. So... shimmering emerald.**
>
> You stepped from nowhere into the Fae Queen's Court, where an endless foyer sprawled. White marble columns adorned with ivy trellises, and arching dome ceilings pocked with stained glass went on and on. Peering through different skylights revealed very, very different skies. Masked nobility moved in eerie unity to a tune you could only hear as if recalling it. Their formal dress and proper fits delayed your realization that behind their masks there were no faces.
>
> Then She found you. Her eminence, Her elegance, Her rapturous, indescribable visage. She offered a green-gloved hand, and said without moving Her mouth, "Dance with me." You took Her grasp before you could so much as consider it. She whirled you into Her arms and back out into Her excited tempo, back and forth, back and forth, for hours, days, weeks, months, years and years and years and years. Your feet grew so weary, but then they were so far away you could not remember having them; your hand clammed from Her touch, but then your hand was made of wood; your lips trembled at Her kiss, and then your lips parted no more, no matter how much you screamed.
>
> It was your first Dancing Dream. You awakened to the same world as you fell asleep to, but something had come between you, as though your home reality lay on the other side of a thin, almost imperceptible veil. You snapped your fingers, just to prove you still had any, and sparks burst from their tips!
>
> First you asked yourself in alarm, "What did She do to me?" But the question faded, as though it had been sucked down into bog-muck. Another query took its place, wriggling to the front of your thoughts like a worm protruding from an apple:
>
> ***What shall you do with My blessing?***

*The Emerald Green* is a tabletop roleplaying game that you play using a 78-card Tarot deck, such as the Smith-Waite (aka Rider-Waite) deck or the Tarot of Marseilles (but not the Thoth deck). You play as a person that has entered into a fae pact which grants you powers, and consumes you. It is intended for use in high fantasy settings similar to the worlds of Faerun or Golarion, where gods are real, and alien.

Players build characters by first *exiling* three cards from their deck, and then *sanctifying* two more. Exiled cards are permanently removed (you can always restore them after the session; your character sheet keeps track) but sanctified cards are allowed to remain in the deck. Together, they form your Pact. Characters gain traits based on what cards are in their pact, whose effects range from increased health or luck, to experience-shaping powers and covenants. You do not pick which traits you gain. You choose what to Pact, and the consequences happen whether you want them or not.

Other highlights:

- You play with a hand of cards, shuffling and drawing at the start of each in-game day. Choose how you respond to challenges by applying one or more cards, discarding them from your hand.
- Challenges may call for responses of a certain sort. Specific suits, odds or evens, major or minor arcana, etc.; failure to respond in kind will punish you.
- Your character's traits are derived from what cards are absent from your deck. Each time you level up, you discard another card, which bequeaths every trait which then matches the cards missing from your deck.

You can read more in the guides. You can use the game tools on this site to make and manage characters and campaigns.
